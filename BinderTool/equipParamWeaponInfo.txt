There are two "special effect" params at 0x44 and 0x48. These are indices into SpEffectParam.param. This param file should be for only one of the weapon effects. The effect value can be found at the following locations:

Posion: 0xCC
Disease: 0xD0
Bleed: 0xD4
Curse: 0xD8
Freeze: 0x1A8
Sleep: 0x338
Madness: 0x33c

Before indexing the params are added to the respective params in the applied ReinforceParamWeapon entry.

The params that determine what effects are displayed are completely separate. They are located at offsets 0x244 and 0x248. These are indices into WeaponEffect.fmg.
There is no value correlating the "value" vs "display" params. The only correlation is the actual message to be displayed, which contains the name of the effect.
