# BinderTool
A Dark Souls III bdt, bhd, bnd, dcx and sl2 unpacking tool

Binaries can be downloaded under [releases](https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool/releases).

If you are looking for the Dark Souls II release check out the [v0.3](https://github.com/Atvaark/BinderTool/tree/v0.3) branch.

## Progress
- [X] Fix decrypting and unpacking DS III files.
- [ ] Create a dictionary
  - [x] Extract file names statically from the application
  - [ ] Extract file names statically from the archive files
  - [ ] Extract file names dynamically from the application
  - *Hooking the hash function and logging all the valid files is probably the right way. Unfortunately the function is inlined at lots of locations in the application. (Search for "imul 37")*
